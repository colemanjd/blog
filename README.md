I'm not satisfied with my resulting data representation. At some points I believe it asks for too much. It makes sense to have a primary key for customers, orders, specific items, etc., but I don't need a primary key for item selection or finalizing an order since the things related to them are unique enough.

Lab 8: Chloe Baker and I worked together on this lab. We initially worked on her repository. I worked until the create the database section of the tutorial. When Chloe started working in the repository again, she pushed something incorrectly and we had to restart. I sent her my lab 8 repository, she copied and pasted, then we worked on her laptop together to finish up. The easiest part of the tutorials is always copy and pasting. A true struggle that I ran into was looking through everything and renaming it to Contoso University. There was multiple times where I thought I was done, tried to run it, then an error popped up because I forgot to change another name. With multiple tables, it's much easier to get lost in where specific items and descriptions can go. On the flips side though, once the tables are specific finding data is much easier.

Lab 9: Samantha was primarily in charge of deployment, and each member of our group helped her with it. My section was Update locally and Deploy. My main struggle was with creating a deployment user and making it line up with my regular Microsoft account. The two weren't supposed to be together, but I assumed if they were things would be easier in the future. I was wrong. 


SW Reflection:
Specific Communication above all is most valuable in carrying out change. Dr. Maslin gave us a good description of what she wanted and we expanded on it. We began to think way too big in comparison to the time provided and our knowledge at the moment. If we reviewed with Dr. Maslin the priority of different qualities of the website, we could have made a better overall website. Instead, we made a satisfactory website with a few great qualities. I've learned that just waiting for someone to do something more times than not leaves us in the same place. If I have a question or need clarification, I need to ask in the moment rather than wait. In the end, I'll learn more and the person I'm asking will learn to communicate in an effective way. Our contract tracing website helps make social and environmental change. As the website progresses, this will be an easier way to keep track of where and when people were in relation to each other. On top of that, communication from a positive test becomes much faster. I've learned the importance of understanding my team's strenghts and weaknesses with how best they work, and how I an support their strengths. I don't want to micromangage and I want my team to work at it's best without us interferring with each other. Meeting as a team is vital to make sure everyone is doing their job and on track to complete the plan that was previously set. The better I understand my team, the better we can plan, the better we can communicate, and the better the final product will be.
