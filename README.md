I'm not satisfied with my resulting data representation. At some points I believe it asks for too much. It makes sense to have a primary key for customers, orders, specific items, etc., but I don't need a primary key for item selection or finalizing an order since the things related to them are unique enough.

Lab 8: Chloe Baker and I worked together on this lab. We initially worked on her repository. I worked until the create the database section of the tutorial. When Chloe started working in the repository again, she pushed something incorrectly and we had to restart. I sent her my lab 8 repository, she copied and pasted, then we worked on her laptop together to finish up. The easiest part of the tutorials is always copy and pasting. A true struggle that I ran into was looking through everything and renaming it to Contoso University. There was multiple times where I thought I was done, tried to run it, then an error popped up because I forgot to change another name. With multiple tables, it's much easier to get lost in where specific items and descriptions can go. On the flips side though, once the tables are specific finding data is much easier.

Lab 9: Samantha was primarily in charge of deployment, and each member of our group helped her with it. My section was Update locally and Deploy. My main struggle was with creating a deployment user and making it line up with my regular Microsoft account. The two weren't supposed to be together, but I assumed if they were things would be easier in the future. I was wrong.
